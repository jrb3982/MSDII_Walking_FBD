This repository contains the embedded software intended for a TI MSP432 microprocessor as a means of collecting, interpreting, and refining data driven by force sensors. Each module focuses on a specific peripheral implemented in meeting this objective.

The general procedure involved is as follows:

1. **Initialization**
2. **Sensor Calibration**
3. **Receive Force Data**
4. **Smooth and Average Data**
5. **Analyze and Feedback Data using PID methods**
